## iOS Code Challenge: Movie Search
### Requirements
You are asked to implement an iOS app that will search for movies through The Movie Database (TMDb). The app will allow us to type in a keyword and then visualize all the movies matching that keyword. For each movie returned, the app will display its title, poster, and overview (short summary of the plot).

- Use the “Search” API provided by https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
- Make a GET request to https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie with the following parameters:
    - api_key: for convenience, use 2a61185ef6a27f400fd92820ad9e8537
    - query: a string representing the keyword we are searching for
- Make a GET request to https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w600_and_h900_bestv2/{poster} to download the poster image for the movie, where {poster} is the value returned by the previous endpoint within the poster_path field.

#### Sample Requests
- Searching for “Harry Potter”: 
    - https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=2a61185ef6a27f400fd92820ad9e8537&query=Harry%20Potter
- Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone poster: 
    - https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w600_and_h900_bestv2/lR4drT4VGfts32j9jYTZUc1a3Pa.jpg

#### Hard Requirements
- The code needs to compile and run in the simulator
- The project should run out of the box in the latest (non-beta) version of Xcode
- No modifications required by the evaluator
- No third party tools or libraries
- The code should not crash under normal usage (searching, scrolling, rotation)
- The code should contain no third party libraries
    - NSCache, NSJSONSerialization, NSURLSession, and UISearchController are your friends
- The code should be performant
- Thread management
- In-memory image caching
- Table cell reuse
- Placeholder for unloaded images
- Other Considerations
- The code should be easy to review
- Be consistent in coding style
- Write comments where necessary
- Write unit tests to cover core business logic
- Not Required
- This project is meant to be narrow in scope, you should not implement:
- Pagination
- Disk-based cache
- UI automation tests
- Your project only needs to support the latest (non-beta) build target

#### Notes
- You are not required to follow the exact design sample provided by us
- Objective-C and Swift code are welcome
- You can use Apple’s Network Link Conditioner to test your app under slow network conditions to test proper caching and cell reuse
- While time to complete a solid answer varies, you should expect to spend around 3-5 hours on the project
- When submitting, email us back a compressed zip file of your project and briefly outline what you would implement, if you were given more time, with the intention of submitting to the App Store
- Please do not share this document publicly
- Please reach out to us if you have questions
